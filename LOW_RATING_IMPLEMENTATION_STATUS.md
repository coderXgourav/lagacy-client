## 📈 Performance Notes

### Google Places API Limits:
- Max 20 results per page
- Max 60 results per query (3 pages)
- 2-second delay between pages required

### To Get 200 Results:
- Need multiple queries with different parameters
- Or use grid-based search approach
- Backend should handle this automatically

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Best Rating Thresholds:
- **3.0 or below**: Good balance (default)
- **2.5 or below**: Very low ratings (strict)
- **3.5 or below**: Below average (moderate)

### Target Businesses:
- Focus on businesses with **10+ reviews** (more credible)
- Avoid businesses with only 1-2 reviews (not enough data)
- Prioritize local businesses (easier to reach)

### Outreach Strategy:
1. Find low-rated businesses
2. Analyze their negative reviews
3. Offer reputation management services
4. Provide website redesign/improvement
5. Track rating improvements
